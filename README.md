# NeuroVolt
A Neuro-Fuzzy BMS integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Neural Networks (NN) on an FPGA for accurate, real-time battery management. Fuzzy logic defines linguistic rules. Handles uncertainty in sensor data. Neural Network Trains on battery data to optimize membership functions and fuzzy rule weights, improving accuracy in nonlinear conditions.
